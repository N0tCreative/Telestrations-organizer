with n number of people broken picture telephone involves each person getting a book, writting something in it, 
the next person has to get the book must draw what was written, the person after that must write what was drawn etc 
until there have been n rounds (each person has contributed once to each book). 
The first thing this should find is all sets of paths that would result in each person getting each book exactly once. 
the second thing this sould find is if its possible for each person to hand their current book to a different person each time.
